//! R2Pipe provides functions to interact with [radare2](http://rada.re/r/)
//!
//! Hence this requires you to have radare2 installed on you system. For more information please
//! refer to the official [radare2 Repository](https://github.com/radare/radare2).
//! The module spawns an instance of r2 and communicates with it over pipes. Using commands which
//! produce a JSON output is recommended as it is easier to parse.
//!
//! R2Pipes are available for a several of languages. For more information about r2pipes in general head over to the
//! [wiki](https://github.com/radare/radare2/wiki/R2PipeAPI).
//!
//! # Design
//! All the functionality for the crate are exposed through two structs: `R2PipeLang` and
//! `R2PipeSpawn`. Typically, there are two ways to invoke r2pipe. One by spawning a child-process
//! from inside r2 and second by making the program spawn a child r2process.
//! `enum R2Pipe` is provided to allow easier use of the library and abstract the difference between these two methods.
//! The `macro open_pipe!()` determines which of the two methods to use.
//!
//! **Note:** For the second method,
//! the path of the executable to be analyzed must be provided, while this is implicit in the first
//! method (executable loaded by r2).
//!
//! # Example
//! ```no_run
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate r2pipe;
//! use r2pipe::R2Pipe;
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut r2p = open_pipe!("/bin/ls").unwrap();
//!     println!("{}", r2p.cmd("?e Hello World"));
//!     let json = r2p.cmdj("ij");
//!     println!("{}", json.pretty());
//!     println!("ARCH {}", json.find_path(&["bin","arch"]).unwrap());
//!     r2p.close();
//! }
//! ```
